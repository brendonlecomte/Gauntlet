# Gauntlet
Bunch of Unimplemented functions with unit tests.

## User
User should write code and use `make` to build and run basic tests on their implementations. This will only run basic tests to check the algorithim works in the simplest form.


## Tester
To run the full suite of tests use `make test` to see how robust the code is. This includes bad param checks, odd data, etc.
