# Gauntlet
Bunch of Unimplemented functions with unit tests. Goal of this is to provide a repo that can be pulled and put in front of a potential employee to see how they handle some simple challenges. 

### User
User should write code and use `make` to build and run basic tests on their implementations.  This will only run basic tests to check the algorithim works in the simplest form.

### Tester
To run the full suite of tests use `make test` to see how robust the code is. This includes bad param checks, odd data, etc. These checks are not fully comprehensive and can be added to as gaps and interesting edge cases come up.
