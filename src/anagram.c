/**
 * \brief   This function takes to strings and compares them to see if they are anagrams.
 *			An anagram is a word which uses exactly the same letters but in a different
 *			order to create a new word. e.g. silent / listen. Assume this function receives
 *			buffers only consisting of characters a-z in lower case. i.e. the inputs are
 *			prepared for you.
 * \param   a      Pointer to the char buffer of word a
 * \param   b      Pointer to the char buffer of word b
 * \return  bool   True if the words are anagrams, False if they are not
